# Guidelines

This page lists guidelines specific to the StudyJams. Every participant in the StudyGroup must adhere to these Guidelines at all times, in addition to the [Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fnplus/code-of-conduct). If you are unfamiliar with the Code of Conduct (CoC), we suggest you read that first before reading this page.

#### Guideline 1 : Prepare your content well

If you are the speaker for any topic during a session, please prepare the content you wish to present before-hand. Sessions are of limited time, and you may need to prioritize on your content to meet the stipulated time. After a brief introduction to your topic, you should present content that's most beneficial to the audience first. Provide sufficient links and resources either before (in your proposal) or after your talk to allow your audience to explore your content further. Well thoughtout content ensures effective use of the stipulated time and also gives a good take-away to the audience.

#### Guideline 2 : Anticipate Q&A

StudyGroups are meant to be more interative. You should provision time within your talk to receive questions from the audience. Q&A also has a stipulated time. You may not be able to answer all questions within the stipulated time; and in such cases you can announce that you'll follow up offline (and you should follow up offline later :) ). It is OK to follow up on questions that you don't have an immediate answer for. It is OK to follow up on questions where you either anticipate a long answer, or an answer that doesn't address to the wider audience.

Do not forget to provide links and email ID to allow your audience to follow up.

#### Guideline 3 : Separate facts & opinions. Seek permission when necessary.

If you are speaking about code which you didn't author, then either refrain from providing opinions or seek permissions from the respective authors about the specific aspects you wish to study or present, and what aspects you wish to cover & highlight. Separate fact from opinion. Chances are; there is more to it than what you know. Understand that participating members may have lesser knowledge than you on the topic you present, and your opinion should not colour what they may be lead to believe.

#### Guideline 4 : Clean your desktop

If you are sharing your screen, ensure that you are not exposing anything that you don't require your audience to know about. Be watchful of other applications that may be open, browser sessions, desktop backgrounds etc. The Code of Conduct applies here as well. Be specifically vigilant of any content that falls into `Intellectual Property` that you absolutely MUST NOT share.
